Joc Pederson makes coffee run

Joc Pederson is one of baseball's most promising prospects, but he's evidently not exempt from tasks typically assigned to rookies.

A photo surfaced Friday of Pederson, wearing his Los Angeles Dodgers uniform, and a clubhouse attendant fetching coffee and other beverages for his teammates.

Pederson posted the photo on his Instagram account prior to the Dodgers' game Friday against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The rookie outfielder wrote "Made a Starbucks run for the team" in the caption next to the photo.


Pederson, the Dodgers' top position prospect, has appeared in 13 games since being promoted to the majors earlier this month, going 3-for-20.

Pederson was named the Pacific Coast League's MVP last month after batting .303 with 33 home runs, 78 RBIs, 106 runs scored and 30 stolen bases for the Dodgers' Triple-A Albuquerque affiliate this season. He became the first Pacific Coast League player to record at least 30 homers and 30 steals in the same season since 1934.

The 22-year-old Pederson was rated as baseball's No. 21 overall prospect earlier this year by ESPN Insider Keith Law.
