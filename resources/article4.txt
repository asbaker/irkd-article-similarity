According to a release by MLB, the goals of the committee will focus on decreasing the time of games and improving the overall pace of play for the 2015 regular season and beyond.

Atlanta Braves president John Schuerholz will chair the committee, which is also composed of New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, MLBPA executive director Tony Clark, Boston Red Sox partner Michael Gordon, MLB commissioner-elect Rob Manfred, MLB executive vice president Joe Torre and Red Sox chairman Tom Werner.

"We have the greatest game in the world, but we are always looking for ways to improve it," Selig said Monday in a statement. "The game is at its highest levels of popularity and we will continue to strive to identify ways that can build on its stature well into the future.

"With the cooperation of all appropriate parties, we can make progress on improving the pace of play, and we will have recommendations in the very near future for the 2015 season. I believe that this group has the experience and the perspective to be mindful of our game's traditions while being creative about our approach in the future."
