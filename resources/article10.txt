After the Alibaba IPO, Is Cash-Gorged Yahoo a Buyer — Or a Seller?

What would you say about an Internet company that is now sitting on upward of $35 billion in cash and relatively liquid assets that still has one of the largest audiences in the Web?

And what would you say if that core business were now worth only about $6 billion? To put it in context, that is a fraction of LinkedIn’s $26 billion market cap, Netflix’s $27.5 billion valuation and just a little bigger than much tinier players like Groupon ($4.7 billion) and Yelp ($5.5 billion).

And what would you say if that company’s value was slashed in half in a single day, as noted by the Wall Street Journal and others, due to the IPO of another company that it holds a very large stake in?

You’d say: Welcome to Yahoo on Monday morning, just after the Alibaba Group IPO on Friday. The massive transaction, which was the largest tech offering in history, most definitely yielded the Silicon Valley Internet giant great riches.

But, according to numerous observers I have spoken to over the weekend, it also finally brought to the clearest light so far the great challenges the company faces as it finally has to define itself without the benefit of riding on the successful coattails of its now rich Chinese friends.



Yahoo shares are down almost five percent already today, an indication that investors have some deep concerns.

While its current 16 percent stake in Alibaba gives it a nice cushion, especially because Yahoo has promised not to sell those shares for at least six months, and could mean possibly higher trading value for shares of the Asian e-commerce giant, most are wondering what is in store for Yahoo in a post-Alibaba era.

“It’s going to be a very interesting fall,” said one top Yahoo exec to me with eyebrows raised high, referring to the next several months and making a clever sideways joke about the possible direction of Yahoo shares. “And it could go either way.”

Either way, the exec was talking about what numerous sources told me: Yahoo has become either a buyer of a very big Web property in order to spur its growth that still has not come in two years of energetic and often frenetic leadership of CEO Marissa Mayer or it has the possibility of becoming one of the tastier acquisition targets out there.

The first option — What Will Marissa Buy? — is one that has been much discussed on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and in the media in the run-up to the Alibaba IPO.

Yahoo has already promised to return at least half of the proceeds of the Alibaba sale — a whopping $5.1 billion after taxes, after Yahoo sold about 122 million shares at $68 each — to shareholders, either via a dividend or a stock buyback. According to numerous investors I spoke with, they would prefer a dividend and many have told Mayer that they also want the entire amount, as well as any gains from future sales of the Alibaba stock sold, rendered up to them.
